<h1>Mental Health Literacy</h1>
	<p>
	What is it? Why is it important? Mental health literacy is simply the adequate understanding of mental illness and it's prevalence throughout the world. Mental health literacy encourages <strong>non-judgmental awareness</strong> and compassion through the destigmatization of mental health disorders nationwide and beyond. As we progress into the new millenium, awareness is becoming <em>more</em> important rather than <em>less</em> important due to the widespread prevalence of the disease and the many ways in which it manifests through the human psyche.
